# CSG README
I can almost guarantee that you have created a class in your life. And if that happens to be true, I **know** that you have dropped a sweat setting up the base of that class. 
```python
class Name:
    def __init__(self,arg1,arg2,arg3,arg4,arg5,arg6,arg7,arg8,arg9...):
        self.arg1 = arg1
        ...hundred years later...
```
Did you know that it was possible to go a day without sweating? Me neither... until I created the ultimate **`"CLASS SNIPPETS GENERATOR!"`** or more commonly known as **`"CSG"`**!
## How To Use

(**`csg`**) is base your prefix 

(**`a`**) stands for arguments

(**`f`**) stands for function

(**`o`**) stands for objects

(**`COUNT`**) add the number of **|** *arguments, functions or objects* **|** next to there designated letter as show below â†“


**EXAMPLE**

| Needed |  Format |   
| ------:|---------------------------------------------------   
| <u>2</u> arg |  csg_a2 |
| <u>2</u> arg <u>3</u> func |  csg_a2_f3 |   
| <u>3</u> func |  csg_f3 |   
| <u>2</u> arg - <u>4</u> objects | csg_a2_o4|
| <u>3</u> func - <u>4</u> objects | csg_f3_o4|
| <u>2</u> arg - <u>3</u> func - <u>4</u> objects | csg_a2_f3_o4|
          
## Known Errors

Please avoid using `0`'s to indicate no *functions* or *attributes*. 

Instead, consider leaving out (`a`,`f`,`o`) entirely.       

**Enjoy!**
