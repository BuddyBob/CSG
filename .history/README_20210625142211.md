# CSG README

I can almost gaurantee that you have created a class in your life. And if that happens to be true, I **know** that you dropped a sweat setting up the base of that class. 
```python
class Name:
    def __init__(self,arg1,arg2,arg3,arg4,arg5,arg6,arg7,arg8,arg9...):
        self.arg1 = arg1
        ...hundred years later...
```
Did you know that it was possible to go a day without sweating? Me neither... until I created the ultimate **CLASS SNIPPETS GENERATOR!**

## How to Use
(**csg**) is your base text 
(**a**) stands for arguments
(**f**) stands for function

**EXAMPLE**
| <u>3</u> arg <u>3</u> func |  csg_a3_f4 |
| ------: | ---------------------------------------------------
